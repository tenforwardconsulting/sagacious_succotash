### How to use:

- Copy this readme below here, replacing sections with your project specific text.
- Comment out or remove any unneeded sections! (HTML comments work inside markdown) 
- But think about it and make sure there really isn't anything you can add before wiping out sections

<!-- HTML comments are cool -->

# <%= app_name.humanize %>

Enter an elevator description for the project. This should be able to explain the project at a high level to a new developer.

If the site is live in production already, include a link and user accounts.
