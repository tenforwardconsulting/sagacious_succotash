### How to use:

- Replace sections with your project specific text.
- Be sure to remove any unneeded sections!
- But think about it and make sure there really isn't anything you can add before wiping out sections.

# <%= app_name.humanize %>

Enter an elevator description for the project. This should be able to explain the project at a high level to a new developer.

If the site is live in production already, include a link and user accounts.
